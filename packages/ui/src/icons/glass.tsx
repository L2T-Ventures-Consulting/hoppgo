// Nucleo Glass icons (https://nucleoapp.com) — the glassmorphism set used for
// dashboard sidebar navigation. Unlike the monochrome barrels these are
// multi-layer SVGs (gradient + blur) that ignore `currentColor`; their palette
// is themed globally through the `--nc-*` CSS variables in styles/globals.css.
//
// License (see /NOTICE): © Nucleo, used under https://nucleoapp.com/license —
// NOT covered by the repository license and requires a valid Nucleo license.
// The most restrictive standard-license project category is capped at 100
// icons, so every icon this app uses must be re-exported from this barrel to
// keep the count auditable. Never copy the SVG sources into the repo; they are
// consumed from Nucleo's official `nucleo-glass` npm package.
